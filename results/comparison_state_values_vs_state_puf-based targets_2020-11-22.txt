Comparison of state results to puf-based state targets

Data are for filers only, using IRS filing requirements plus estimates of likely filing.

Note that comparisons are to puf-based state targets, not to actual Historical Table 2 targets:

  For example, if the HT2 U.S. total for a variable is $100 and the IRS national total for
  the variable is $95, then each state target will be a pro-rata share of the $95, based
  upon the state share of $100, and the comparison in the tables below is to the pro-rata
  share of $95.

This report has the following sections:
  * Summary report for # of returns in each state
  * Summary report for all variables in New York
  * Details by income range for each variable in New York
  * Details by income range for selected variables in each state
